Forgotten bash commands
===================================

There are a few usefull bash commands I came across during my software career, that has a special meaning and should be used more often. I guess everyone has theyre own workflow, but mine works well with the few forgotten ones below:

pushd
-----
Directory stack tool used in shell scripting 

.. code-block:: console
$ pushd 


popd
----
Directory stack tool used in shell scripting 

.. code-block:: console
$ popd
