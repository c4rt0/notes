Ask questions - they say there's no stupid questions.
Keeping things to yourself will slow down your progress.
Talk to others, use standup as a quick problem solving solution.
Dont get stuck by yourself - there's a team to help you go green.
Divide problems to smaller groups - attack single units, not a whole army
SLI is important - dont be afraid to admit you're yellow/red
Squash commits, one commit per problem  is better then 36
